This game currently minimally requires a two-button mouse and, for the harder game modes, a screen resolution of at least 1366Ã—768.

Clear the fields that have no mines underneath by left-clicking them. You can protect a field by placing a flag: right-click adds and also removes a flag.

Hit a bomb and you lose!

Clearing all fields without bombs wins the game.

Try and beat your best time!
