This game currently minimally requires a two-button mouse a screen resolution of at least 1366Ã—768 for the harder game modes.

Clear the fields that have no mines underneath by left-clicking them. You can protect a field by placing a flag: right-click adds and also removes a flag. (Ctrl + left click also counts as a right-click.)

Hit a bomb and you lose!

Clearing all fields without bombs wins the game.

Try and beat your best time!

=== How to start and how to select a level ===

Start playing by clearing fields or planting flags.

When the first field has been cleared, the timer starts.

Upon a win or a loss you can select larger boards. Larger boards don't just contain more fields but also disproportionally more bombs. In other words, a larger field is not just more work to clear, but also harder to clear.
