# Mines 

This game currently minimally requires a screen resolution of at least 1366Ã—768 for the harder game modes.

Clear the fields that have no mines underneath by left-clicking them. 

You can protect a field by placing a flag: right-click adds and also removes a flag. (Ctrl + left click also counts as a right-click.)

Hit a bomb and you lose!

Clearing all fields without bombs wins the game.

Although the game starts with trial and error, clearing fields will provide hints for the state of the neighbouring fields: a number will show how many bombs are hidden in the adjacent fields.

Try and beat your best time!

## How to start and how to select a level

Start playing by clearing fields or planting flags.

When the first field has been cleared, the timer starts.

Upon a win or a loss you can select larger boards. Larger boards don't just contain more fields but also disproportionally more bombs. In other words, a larger field is not just more work to clear, but also harder to clear.
